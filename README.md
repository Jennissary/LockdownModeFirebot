# LockdownModeFirebot
A simple safety setup with a Preset Effects List and commands for locking down your channel mid-stream.
Whether it's due to unusually high viewer counts, a chat feud, or a friendly raid, this will perform the following effects: 
- Turns on followers only (minimum 30 minutes)
- Turns on unique chat
- Turns on slow mode (10 seconds)
- Posts a chat message saying what's happening

This is a preset effects list, so it can be activated from an event, hotkey, streamdeck, or the included commands: !lockdown, !lockdown off.
